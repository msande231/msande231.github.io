# Project

**Due Date: Tuesday December 13th at 5pm Pacific Time**

## Options

We're offering three different types of projects you can pursue:

1. Skim a few papers from the syllabus. Pick one to read carefully, including supplemental material. Write a referee report on the paper 
   (published papers are not flawless!).
2. Replicate an analysis from a published paper, possibly extending but emphasis on replication. Use either the original data if available
   or similar data if not.
3. Explore an empirical or theoretical research question.

Mixing and elements from these is ok as long as your project does _at least_ as much as one of these options.
   
## Details

A few details on organization:
- The group size is 3-5 students. We don't expect to offer any variations from this. Please make a post on Ed in the group formation thread 
  to find people to work with here: https://edstem.org/us/courses/30212/discussion/1855572
- Once you have your group, please make time to get feedback from or iterate on ideas with the TAs, via private Ed post or office hours.

The project comprises the following deadlines:
1. **Proposal:** Write a ~0.5-1 page proposal describing your intended project work (references don't count towards limit). Due remotely Tuesday Nov 8th (election day, no class!). Please only submit this PDF to Gradescope.
2. **Presentations:** Due in class Tuesday Dec 6th, Thursday Dec 8th. Please only submit the presentation PDF to Gradescope.
3. **Project Report:** Due remotely Tuesday Dec 13th, 5pm PT. Please submit the PDF to Gradescope, and all files in a .zip to Canvas.

## Submission instructions

*Note that these are different from Assignment submission instructions!*

For the *Project Report*, we ask that all project files (code and data) be uploaded to Canvas. For the Proposal, Presentation, and Project Report, we ask that a PDF be uploaded to Gradescope.

To help make sure your team gets the deliverables submitted correctly, here's a submission checklist:

1. Write the names of all your group members, and your group number, into the PDF. If you submit source files, make sure at least one of the source code files has all the names of your group members and your group number in a comment near the top. This is important to complete, as we may assign individual grades if we see major discrepancies between different parts of the project, so that everyone is treated fairly.
2. Write the names of each group member and which parts of the project they worked on at the top of your PDF. You can all work on each part or split it up in any way you'd like. For example, for the project report, you can write: "Person A (`data.py`, report); Person B (`analysis.py`, report); Person C: (report)''.
3. Go to the People page on Canvas, hit the Groups tab, and ensure that you're in the right group with the right people. If there's anyone else in your group who you are not working with, please email the TA team or make a private post on Ed so that they can be moved to the right group. We'll be using these groups to assign grades, so it's very important that they're correct. The group set for all three submissions for the project is "Project".
4. For the proposal and presentation, just submit the PDF on Gradescope. On Gradescope, the group is not automatically recorded, so you'll have to select your group members when you submit. Only one person has to submit the PDF.
5. For the project report, zip all files which went into creating the report (this includes Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, the submission PDF, etc.) and submit the .zip file to Canvas. Only one person has to submit the files. Your group and its members will automatically be recorded on the submission.


**Good luck!**
