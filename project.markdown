# Project

**Due Date: TBD, during Exam Week**

## Options

We're offering three different project templates to base your project upon:

1. Skim a few papers from the syllabus. Pick one to read carefully, including supplemental material. Write a referee report on the paper 
   (published papers are not flawless!).
2. Replicate an analysis from a published paper, possibly extending but emphasis on replication. Use either the original data if available
   or similar data if not.
3. Explore an empirical or theoretical research question.
   
## Details

A few details on organization:
- The group size is 3-5 students. We don't expect to offer any variations from this. Please make a post on Ed in the group formation thread 
  to find people to work with!
- Once you have your group, please make time to get feedback from or iterate on ideas with the TAs, via private Ed post or office hours.

The project comprises the following deadlines:
1. **Proposal:** Write a ~0.5-1 page proposal describing your intended project work. Due 11/8 (election day, no class!)
2. **Presentations:** In class Tu 12/6, Th 12/8
3. **Project report due:** Tu 12/13, 5p PT 

## Submission instructions

We ask that all project files (code and data) be uploaded to Canvas, and that a PDF of the report be uploaded to Gradescope.

To help make sure your team gets the deliverables submitted correctly, here's a project submission checklist:   

1. Write the names of all your group members, and your group number, into the report PDF and at least one of the source code files you submit. This is important to complete, as we may assign individual grades if we see major discrepancies between different parts of the project, so that everyone is treated fairly.
2. Write the names of each group member and which parts of the project they worked on at the top of your project PDF. You can all work on each part or split it up in any way you'd like. For example, you can write: "Person A (report); Person B (`tweet_analysis.py`); Person C: (report)''.
3. Go to the People page on Canvas, hit the Groups tab, and ensure that you're in the right group with the right people. If there's anyone else in your group who you are not working with, please email the TA team or make a private post on Ed so that they can be moved to the right group. We'll be using these groups to assign grades, so it's very important that they're correct.
4. Now, submit all files you made to create your report to the assignment on Canvas. This includes Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, the submission PDF, etc. Only one person has to submit the files. Your group and its members will automatically be recorded on the submission.
5. Finally, please submit just the report PDF on Gradescope. On Gradescope, the group is not automatically recorded, so you'll have to select your group members when you submit. Only one person has to submit the PDF.


**Good luck!**
